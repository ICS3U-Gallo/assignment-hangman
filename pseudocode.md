# Hangman (Pseudocode)

```
Get a word to try to get the user to guess.

Ask user to guess a letter
>check if it is a letter

Check if the letter is in the word
>if it is, rememeber that the letter has been used, print where it is in the word

>if it is not, tell the user that it is not. Store the letter as already checked and "draw new body part.

If the body is complete, the computer wins. If the complete word is guessed, player wins. Else, start the program from step 2.
```
