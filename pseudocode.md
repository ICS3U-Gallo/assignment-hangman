# Hangman (Pseudocode)

```
Write pseudocode here, within the tripple backticks.

1. create new drawing of a post with a hanging noose (head on top)
2. ask player for a word
3. split word into seperate letters
4. prompt player two to guess the letters
5. if more than 2 total players, alternate turns between guessers
6. for every incorrect guess, add one of five body parts to the noose (chest, left and right arms, left and right legs)
7. continue process until either players gets the correct letters, or loses all five body parts
